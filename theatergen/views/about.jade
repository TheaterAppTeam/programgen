            | The idea of this independent study project originated as an extentsion from Brandeis Theater Company's production of
            i  The Spaces Between Us
            |  in 2017.
            |         EZ-Plays aims to reduce paper waste in the theater and push for new sustainability tactics from the Brandeis University administration.
