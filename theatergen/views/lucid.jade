      br
      i Lucid
      |  examines the persistence of humanity within a world in ruins, the result of physical degradation, social decay, and administrative disrepair. The harsh conditions of this world necessitate constant sacrifices and the breaking of bonds. But, miraculously, with this destruction comes resurrection: the development of understandings, the formation of alliances, and the anticipation of honest unification.

      br
      |       The name
      i Lucid
      |  was inspired largely by the remarkable qualities of lucid dreaming, a phenomenon that disrupts definitions of reality, fantasy, and control. Portraying conditions that may first appear unrealistic to many viewers, the play suggests that its narrative is not very different from current reality. As in a lucid dream, where the dreamer has control over the events they face, we have all participated in shaping the dreamlike world presented in
      i Lucid
      | .
      br
      br
      i Lucid
      | ’s set, as well as the process of its design, mirrors the dynamic between subconscious and conscious actions that is found in the play. Much of
      i Lucid
      | ’s set was sourced from the trash generated by those working on this production and others in the community, giving these single-use objects a second life, while also prompting serious thought about the ecological ramifications of seemingly innocuous everyday choices. The set for
      i Lucid
      |  is an exploration of sustainability and thoughtfulness in design. Nearly all of the materials that comprise the set are being reused, and those that are new will be recycled after the production.
      br
      br
      |       This play was largely inspired by the book The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future written by historian of science Naomi Oreskes and historian Erik M. Conway. Lucid is set in the northeastern United States in 2081.
