      b A note from Lilia:
      br
      br
      |       My father came here as a refugee. When I ask him questions about his past life in the Soviet Union, he answers, “Ah...you know. What difference does it make?” I think there’s a feeling that even I, his child, won’t understand. Or, perhaps, I won’t understand especially because I am his. In any case, I have come to accept that our relationship grows better in these silences, these spaces between language, culture, and mentality. I wanted to make a project that cuts deep into gaps of human understanding.
      br
      br
      |       The project began after I read a short story by Yoshimoto Banana by the same title, a translation from the original Japanese. It is the story of a young woman who escapes her upbringing in a religious cult to find a home in secular, urban society. Her images evoked a sense of a shared eroticism between the search for a lover or soulmate and the search for forgiveness for leaving her family behind.
      br
      br
      |       In collecting other material, such as the short story by I.L. Peretz, What is A Soul? and the film The Dreamers by Bernardo Bertolucci, it became clear I wanted to make a world that functions on the human need to be found when one loses oneself, whether we be found by country, by God, by our parents, by our children. What roles has society cut out and what stories do we cling to for this to be possible and at what cost to both the individual and national consciousness?
      br
      br
      |       These are big, heavy questions that I wanted to explore with a sense of absurdism, fun, and mysticism. Clowning, epic myth and storytelling, dance, and music play a vital role in the piece, as they do in our everyday lives as people. I am delighted you are here to experience the project with us.
      br
      br
      |       I would like to thank Professors Jen Cleary, Susan Dibble, Dmitry Troyanovsky, Ellen Kellman, Matthew Fraleigh, and Stephen McCauley, for in your own individual way you have helped me find a voice as a writer. Thank you to Alicia Hyland and Alex Jacobs for your support and care. Thank you to Joelle, for your questions, love, work, and passion. Thank you to the cast for your openness and drive. Thank you to my mother Liz for all the dreams, my father Boris for the reality checks, and to my brother Rafael for the devotion and strong example over many years.

      |       This project is in memory of Cazimir Liske, an artist who taught with much joy and purpose, and I wish you all could have met him.
