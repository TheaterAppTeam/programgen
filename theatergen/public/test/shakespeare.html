    <y><b> A note from Sara:</b></y> <br><br>
    <e>When we talk about the intersection between “women” and “power,” the women populating Shakespeare’s plays truly run the gamut of what power can be: they are the all- seeing prophets, savage queens, comic cross-dressers, strong-willed witches, conspiring mistresses, and quick-witted shrews. But how they navigate female power, what that
becomes in terms of gender expression, and redefining what it means to be “woman,” is what, I think, makes them so distinct and groundbreaking. <br><br>
“But!” you cry, “Where is the tragedy in that?”<br><br>
In spite of their presence on the page and stage, there still exists the critical issue of
how we engage with them in a performance space beyond traditional definitions of
womanhood, beyond viewing them as subjugated victims, or strictly in service of
patriarchal prerogatives. With more all-women Shakespeare companies and productions
on the rise, the questions of “Who are Shakespeare’s women?” and “What are women
anyway?” have burst into public consciousness, and I have found it increasingly vital to
be an active voice in participating in and even guiding these conversations.<br><br>
In constructing this piece, I sought to engage a traditional narrative or reading with a more
feminist one. I ask: how do we read Shakespeare’s women in an empowering way while
honoring the text? What do these forms of power look like in performance? What makes
“the woman,” or how do we grapple with such an unfixed definition in a single hour? <br><br>
When we take a closer look at the circumstances of these characters, we do not just see
hotheaded shrews with fiery tongues and male disguises, but lively women who navigate
their way through patriarchal structures and find agency and even opportunity within
those bounds. At the crux of this piece, we celebrate The Unconventional Woman. We
celebrate the bravery that comes with breaking the rules, defying gender expectations,
and finding unchecked freedom and life in body and expression. The women in this piece
remind us what it means to vitally take up space, and not just within the worlds that
Shakespeare wrote, but also for women performers in the theatre community at large.<br><br>
I am so thankful for the support I have received over the course of this process: to Susan
and Alicia, for your unmatched guidance and listening ears; to Tom King, for always
embracing and expanding my perspective; and to Sarah Hickler, for your brilliant
workshop and acute notes. <br><br>
I also must emphasize that this project would not exist without the efforts of the
#$hakespeareGirlz team: The Most Honorable Actress Rachel Greene, The Ever-Steadfast
Stage Manager Hana Cornwell, and the other half of my conscience, The Oft-Inspiring
Director Andrew Child – my gratitude to you all knows no bounds. Thank you for your
patience, good humor, and above all, love of the work. “I can no other answer
make but thanks, and thanks; and ever thanks.” (Twelfth Night, III.iii) <br><br>
