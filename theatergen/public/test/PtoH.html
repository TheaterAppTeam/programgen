    Salena loves theatre, especially when she acts in a role she can connect with. She is an English and Creative Writing major with a pen for poetry. This show is like poetry to her. Keturah is an inspiration for Salena, not only as a prominent black woman figure on campus, but as a friend. She is excited to get the opportunity to do stories, like Keturah’s, justice on the stage. But she is even more excited to help her sister call all of you out on your bullsh*t. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackActorsMatter #BlackWomeninTheatreMatter <br>
