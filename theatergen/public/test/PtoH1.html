    <b> Salena Deane (Young KT/Her) </b> <br>
    Salena loves theatre, especially when she acts in a role she can connect with. She is an English and Creative Writing major with a pen for poetry. This show is like poetry to her. Keturah is an inspiration for Salena, not only as a prominent black woman figure on campus, but as a friend. She is excited to get the opportunity to do stories, like Keturah’s, justice on the stage. But she is even more excited to help her sister call all of you out on your bullsh*t. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackActorsMatter #BlackWomeninTheatreMatter <br>
    <b> Tyffany English (Rebecca/Inner BB2)</b> <br>
    Tyffany is double majoring in Economics and Creativity, the Arts, and Self-Transformation. She is from Buford, Georgia and is an Atlanta Posse Scholar. She has theater experience working as a costume tech in competition plays and as an actress in <i>The Princess Plays</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. She was the assistant director of <i>The Love of the Nightingale</i>. She is the president of the Fashion Design Club, has been on the Brandeis Cheer squad since her freshman year, and has written for HerCampus. <br>
    <b> Wil Jones (Boy 1/Deonte/Wallace)</b> <br>
    Wil will graduate this May with a degree in African and Afro-American Studies. Previous roles include <i>Uncle Henry, The Gatekeeper,</i> and a Flying Monkey in the Undergraduate Theater Collective's 2016 production of <i>The Wiz</i>. <br>
