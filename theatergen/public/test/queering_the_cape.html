  <y><b> A note from Tres:</b></y> <br><br>
  <e>Years ago, my Aunt Veronica sent me a package in the mail full of various trade paperback
collected editions including <i>Fantastic Four: Flesh and Stone, Teen Titans: Life and Death,
New Avengers: The Sentry</i>, and many more that are all still a part of the collection of
comic books, trade paperbacks, and graphic novels in my dorm room right now. Among
them was <i>The X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga</i>, the story that I consider to have truly
launched my love for comic books into something obsessive. <br><br>
While turning my knowledge of comic books and the industry around them into something
academic has been a goal of mine for a long time, I wasn’t aware of the route I would be
taking to do that until I began take queer studies courses here at Brandeis. As the person
constantly writing reflections on our readings tying them into Wonder Woman and the
X-Men, I was excited by the idea of turning my thoughts into something theatrical when
my Introduction to Queer Studies professor, Tom King, told me that it would be worth
exploring. From that, the proposal for this show was born, but simply with the concept
that I would be addressing the overlap between queer theory and American superhero
comic books and no knowledge of how I would do it. <br><br>
At this point, <i>Queering the Cape</i> was a personal piece I wanted to use to express my thoughts on the topic. However, it was only through conversations with other people that
I learned this show would take the shape it did. The script’s aim developed into wanting
to talk about what it’s like to be a queer comic book reader and why people find a sense
of safety in these stories. That was how the premise of the show came to be and how
the characters of Ed, JB, Garder, and Kos came to life. I learned throughout this process
that this script could be more than my stab at theory but also a story that many people
want to help tell and hear. My hope is that this product allows queer people to talk about
their love of comic books, tackles a highly academic conversation, and makes my Aunt
Veronica grateful that she decided to send me those trade paperbacks all those years ago. <br><br>
I couldn’t have gotten here without the incredible help of so many people: Haia for
turning my words into so much more than I could have ever imagined; Delaney for
trusting me project after project ever since <i>Little Shop of Horrors<i> and pulling the strings
for me one last time after many years; the cast of Ben, Charlie, Alex, and Ryan for bringing
these characters to life with more personality than I could have ever done on my own;
my advisors—both official and unofficial—Jen, Susan, and Alicia for getting me through
a process I had never even attempted before; and Emma, Becca, and Raphael who have
not only been great support but also were the reason I never gave up on my own writing.
The biggest thanks of all goes to my Aunt Veronica, to whom this project is dedicated. <br><br>
