        EZ-Plays is a web application that was designed, built and curated by three Brandeis University Computer Science seniors.
        EZ-Plays auto generates play programs that can be easily accessed to audiences while keeping the nostalgic feel of a physical programs.
        The idea of this independent study project originated as an extentsion from Brandeis Theater Company's production of <i> The Spaces Between Us</i> in 2017.
        EZ-Plays aims to reduce paper waste in the theater and push for new sustainability tactics from the Brandeis University administration.

          Joelle loves combining her muliple passions together and this project allowed her to do just that.
          Joelle has been acting since she was in middle school and later she learned how to code. Since then, she has been utilizing her technical skills to address important problems in our society. She has created a
      3D game to protest for women's reproductive health rights, a web app to promote sustainable living and more! Joelle thanks
    Alicia Hyland for sharing her amazing idea and Adrianne Krstansky for her mentorship in theater! She also thanks Professor Hickey for his guidance and care. S/O to her COSI Struggle Bus Squad!

          Demi is honored to have the opportunity to work on this project with the Brandeis Theater Arts Department.
          She has always been really passionate about developing useful technology in a variety of different areas.
          In high school, she designed and developed the website for her high school's Guidance Department. During the summer of
          her sophomore year of college, she participated in JBS and created a voice-integrated cooking recipe application called
          "Chef's Assistant" with Gerriana Cohen and Fatima Hussaini. She wants to thank Professor Hickey and Alicia Hyland for
          giving her the opportunity to work on this project as well as Joelle Robinson and Fatima Hussaini for being her
          Computer Science buddies.

          <b>Bio: Fatima is a graduating senior who is passionate about computer science, specifically web development. As a summer project, Fatima along with Demi Zhang and Gerriana Cohen created a hands-free recipe application that allowed users to find recipes based on a variety of filters.
            She also worked as a data analyst intern at Boston Children's Hospital where she was responsible for implementing a diffusion tensor algorithm to analyze functional MRI data.
          This project has allowed her to apply both her creativity and technical skills while also expanding her knowledge about web development technologies and techniques.
        It has been a pleasure working on this application with Professor Hickey, Demi, and Joelle and wants to thank all of them for working on this project with her and being an amazing support system.  </b>
