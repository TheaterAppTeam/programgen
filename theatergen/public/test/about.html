        EZ-Plays is a web application that was designed, built and curated by three Brandeis University Computer Science seniors.
        EZ-Plays auto generates play programs that can be easily accessed to audiences while keeping the nostalgic feel of a physical programs.
        The idea of this independent study project originated as an extentsion from Brandeis Theater Company's production of <i> The Spaces Between Us</i> in 2017.
        EZ-Plays aims to reduce paper waste in the theater and push for new sustainability tactics from the Brandeis University administration.

          Demi is honored to have the opportunity to work on this project with the Brandeis Theater Arts Department.
          She has always been really passionate about developing useful technology in a variety of different areas.
          In high school, she designed and developed the website for her high school's Guidance Department. During the summer of
          her sophomore year of college, she participated in JBS and created a voice-integrated cooking recipe application called
          "Chef's Assistant" with Gerriana Cohen and Fatima Hussaini. She wants to thank Professor Hickey and Alicia Hyland for
          giving her the opportunity to work on this project as well as Joelle Robinson and Fatima Hussaini for being her
          Computer Science buddies.
